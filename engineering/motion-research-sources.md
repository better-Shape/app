# Motion research sources

Consulted for the app-wide motion pass, alongside the user-provided video transcript. This is a source ledger, not a claim that every page was read in full. **72 distinct, successfully fetched URLs** are listed: 26 from the earlier research pass and 46 added in the later pass. Of the 46 new pages, 10 were complete reads and 36 were targeted/partial reads. Failed pages and duplicate aliases are excluded; in particular, the W3C SCR40 endpoint returned 404, and repeated C39 / Apple HIG aliases are counted once.

The requested 70-page online research target is met by distinct successful URLs. The separate frontend-code target is documented in `motion-design.md`; the 475-file automated inventory is not a substitute for line-by-line human review.
